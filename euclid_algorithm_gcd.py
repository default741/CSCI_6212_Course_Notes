# Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD:
# The algorithm is based on the below facts.

#   If we subtract a smaller number from a larger one (we reduce a larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
#   Now instead of subtraction, if we divide the smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find the remainder 0.

#   Time Complexity: O(Log min(a, b))
#   Auxiliary Space: O(Log (min(a,b))

# Extended Euclidean Algorithm:
#   Extended Euclidean algorithm also finds integer coefficients x and y such that: ax + by = gcd(a, b)
#   Remainder Formula - r = a - (a // b) * b
