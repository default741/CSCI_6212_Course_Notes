(Staircase/Pareto-Optimal Points)

Let P be a set of n points in a 2-dimensional plane.
A point p in P is Pareto-Optimal if no other point is both above and to the rignt of p.
The sorted sequence of Pareto-Optimal points describes a top-right staircase with the interior points of P below and to the left of the staircase.
We want to compute this staircase.

1. Describe an algorithm to compute the staircase of P in O(nh) time, where h is the number of Pareto-Optimal Points.
2. Describe a divide and conquer algorithm to compute the staircase of P in O(n * log(n)) time.
3. Describe an algorithm to compute the staircase of P in O(n * log(h)) time, where h is the number of Pareto-Optimal Points.
4. Finally, suppose the points in P are already given in sorted order from left to right. Describe an algorithm to compute the staircase of P in O(n) time.
